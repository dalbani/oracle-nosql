<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Oracle NoSQL Database is a distributed key-value store capable of scaling
horizontally to handle very large amounts of data.
</p>
<p>
The Oracle NoSQL Database server is compatible with Java SE 8 and later,
and the client is compatible with Java SE 6 and later.  Both have been
tested and certified against Oracle Java SE 8 Update 73.  We encourage
you to upgrade to the latest Java releases to take advantage of the
latest bug fixes and performance improvements.
</p>
<p>
Attempting to use this release with a version of Java earlier than the
required version will produce an error message similar to:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
  oracle/kv/impl/util/KVStoreMain : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="release">This Release</a></h2>
<p>
Release 12cR1.4.0.9 Community Edition of Oracle NoSQL Database is a major
release. We strongly recommend that users of earlier versions upgrade to
this release.
</p>
<p>
This release contains some preview release features.  We encourage users
to try these new features and provide feedback through the forums.  Note
that preview release features should not be used in production
applications and may also change prior to their final release.
</p>
<h2><a name="features">New Features</a></h2>
<!-- Descriptions major features for the initial major release and
     subsequent minor releases, in reverse order -->
<h3>New in Release 4.0</h3>
<p>
For a complete listing of all the changes made to Oracle NoSQL
Database for this release (including all bug fixes) see
the <a href="changelog.html">change log</a>.
</p>
<h4>Query</h4>
<p>
Added a preview release of an SQL-style declarative query language to
support server side predicates, filtering, and projection of table
data. The new features include the language itself, APIs for querying
and results handling, as well as a new interactive shell to exercise
queries.
</p>
<h4>Full Text Search</h4>
<p>
Added a preview release of integration with Elasticsearch to provide
full text search indexing.  Text indexes can be added to tables in
Oracle NoSQL Database, which will cause a corresponding index in an
attached Elasticsearch cluster to be populated and maintained.
</p>
<h4>TTL</h4>
<p>
Added support for Time-To-Live (TTL), which allows applications to
request automatic purging of records after a given time interval.  A
default TTL can be specified for all entries in a table, and a TTL value
can also be specified for individual table operations.  For applications
whose data should expire over time, the TTL feature provides better
performance than deleting records explicitly.
</p>
<h4>Export/Import Utility</h4>
<p>
Added Export and Import utilities. The new utilities allows users to
export the contents from Oracle NoSQL Database store to either the local
file system or to the Oracle Storage Cloud Service, and to import
contents from the locations into an Oracle NoSQL Database store.
</p>
<h3>Distributions</h3>
<p>
    Oracle NoSQL Database comes in three distributions:
    Community Edition (CE), Enterprise Edition (EE), and Client.
</p>
<p>
    The CE version is open source. It ships with source code and is
    released under the Affero General Public License (aGPL v3). It
    includes the client and server distribution, but does not include
    some server features.
</p>
<p>
    The EE version does not include source code and it ships with an
    Oracle license. The EE version includes the client and server
    distribution, and includes several features not found in the CE version:
    SNMP support for monitoring the store, Oracle External Tables
    support, Oracle Wallet support for external password storage, and
    support for Kerberos authentication.
</p>
<p>
    The Client version is open source. It ships with source code and is
    released under the Apache 2.0 License (Apache 2.0).  The Client
    version only contains the implementation of the client API, which
    may be used to access servers running under either CE or EE.
</p>
<h2><a name="building">Building from Source Code in the Community
Edition</a></h2>
<p>
If you have downloaded the Community Edition, you can use the included
Ant build script to rebuild JAR files if you make source changes.
</p>
<p>
You need Apache Ant version 1.9.0 or later in order to do builds.  You
can download Ant from:
</p>
<blockquote>
http://ant.apache.org/
</blockquote>
<p>
You also need Apache Ivy for loading dependencies.  You can download Ivy
from:
</p>
<blockquote>
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/
</blockquote>
<p>
Make sure to add the ivy JAR file to your <tt>~/.ant/lib</tt> directory
or specify the ivy directory using the ant <tt>-lib</tt> option.
</p>
<p>
The default Ant target will rebuild all JAR files.
</p>
<h2><a name="issues">Known Issues</a></h2>
<h3>Weak quorum checks when changing zone types</h3>
<p>
When you change the type of a zone by using the <code>topology
change-zone-type</code> and <code>plan deploy-topology</code> commands
in the Admin CLI, the plan command only checks for shard quorum at the
time that nodes within a shard are updated, not when the plan begins
executing.  As a result, if one or more shards do not have quorum when
the plan executes, some of modifications needed to change the type of
the zone may be performed before the plan fails due to a lack of shard
quorum.  If this happens, you should correct the problems that produced
the lack of quorum and then retry the command. [#24503]
</p>
<h3>Dropping users and tables</h3>
<p>
When you drop a user, it is required to drop tables owned by the user
before dropping the user. Similarly, when dropping a table, it is
required to revoke privileges related to a table before dropping the
table. These requirements will be removed in future release. [#24273]
</p>
<h3>Some recent versions of Hive contain a bug that breaks Hive/NoSQL integration</h3>
<p>
A bug was introduced in the Hive 1.1.0 source of the Cloudera's 5.4.5
release; that is, hive-1.1.0-cdh5.4.5. This bug prevents the creation and
mapping of Hive external tables to corresponding NoSQL tables. Although
Cloudera has created a patch for this bug, as of this writing, the bug
currently exists in the following CDH releases:
<ul>
  <li>hive-1.1.0-cdh5.4.5
  <li>hive-1.1.0-cdh5.4.7
  <li>hive-1.1.0-cdh5.4.8
  <li>hive-1.1.0-cdh5.5.0
</ul>

(Note that Cloudera produced no 5.4.6 or 5.4.9 releases.)
<p>
For information on the specifics of the change that was introduced, refer to
Hive bugs <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12406">HIVE-12406</a>
and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9500">HIVE-9500</a>.
<p>
If you are using a version of CDH Hive prior to hive-1.1.0-cdh5.4.5,
this bug will not affect you. On the other hand, if you are using one
of the versions listed above, then rather than installing an older
version, you can obtain the patch from Cloudera and apply it to
your current Hive installation. The patch can be obtained from
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12773587/HIVE-12406.2.patch">this link</a>.
</p>
<h3>Missing query results</h3>
<p>
The result set of a query may be missing some results, if (a) an index
is used to answer the query, (b) the index is indexing one or more
nullable fields, and (c) there are table rows that do actually contain
NULL values for the indexed fields. This is because, in the current
implementation, indexes cannot contain NULL values. [#24952] [#24785]
</p>
<h3>Duplicate query results</h3>
<p>
The result set of a query may contain duplicate results, if a multi-key
index is used to answer the query. A multi-key index is an index on an
array or map field. The duplicate results are due to the fact that the
index will, in general, contain multiple entries for each table row, and
in the current implementation, duplicate eleimination is not
done. [#25023]
